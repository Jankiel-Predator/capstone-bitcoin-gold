Requirements for the project:
1. Time Series Recognition:
   - Ability to identify time series data.
   - Determination of basic dependencies in time series.
   - Decomposition of time series into components: trend, seasonality, residual series.

2. Examining Time Series Properties:
   - Analysis of stationarity using appropriate statistical tests.
   - Performing transformations on time series.
   - Creating auxiliary plots.

3. Preparation for Modeling:
   - Splitting data into training and test sets.
   - Selecting an appropriate model for time series analysis.
   - Conducting the model training process.
   - Making predictions using the model.
   - Evaluating the effectiveness of the obtained model.


_____________________________________________________
 - To evaluate the project, the contribution of each group member must be clearly stated.
- All sources used in the project must be included. If AI tools were used, a list of prompts should be attached. If AI was not utilized, this must be explicitly noted in the file.
